# BinHQ APIs

This repository contains the contracts for public BinHQ APIs in the form of
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (version 3),
which is Google's Interface Definition Language (IDL).

The main specialty of protobuf is that using the same definition
it's quite easy to create APIs supporting both REST and gRPC protocols.
